## Structure

Using only PHP files, it have four divisions:
- Header
- Hero
- Projects
- Footer

Each division has your own file with her self responsability, doing a componentization of project for a good organization of it

## Server

Ofcourse you can run the project inside a xampp or any another method to turn on your php server, but inside project has a docker to help you turn on it easily
